## What is FlowPay?

Recurring payments are one of the hardest problems in crypto. Every billing cycle, users have to manually send funds — there's no native mechanism for a service to pull payments on a schedule.

FlowPay solves this. It is a Soroban smart contract that lets users **approve a contract to charge them periodically**. Merchants and creators get paid automatically. Users stay in full control and can cancel at any time.

Think of it as **Stripe Subscriptions, but trustless and on-chain** — built natively on the Stellar network using the Soroban smart contract platform.

---

## Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Recurring Subscriptions** | Users set up a subscription once. The contract enforces the billing interval on every charge attempt. |
| **Allowance-Based Spending** | Uses Soroban's token `transfer_from` — the contract only moves funds the user has explicitly approved. |
| **Pay-Per-Use Microtransactions** | Charge arbitrary amounts instantly against an active subscription. Ideal for metered/usage-based billing. |
| **Cancel Anytime** | Users can cancel their subscription in a single transaction. No lock-ins. |
| **Any SAC Token** | Works with native XLM or any Stellar Asset Contract (USDC, custom tokens). |
| **On-Chain Events** | Every action emits a contract event (`subscribed`, `charged`, `cancelled`, `pay_per_use`) for easy indexing. |

---

## Use Cases

- **SaaS tools** — charge users monthly for software access
- **Content creators** — fan subscriptions and newsletter paywalls
- **DAOs & communities** — recurring membership dues
- **Metered APIs** — pay-per-call billing using `pay_per_use`
- **Payroll** — automate recurring salary disbursements

---

## How It Works

```
1. User calls approve() on the token contract
   → grants FlowPay an allowance (e.g. 60 XLM for 12 months)

2. User calls subscribe(merchant, amount, interval)
   → subscription stored on-chain, last_charged = now

3. Backend/keeper calls charge(user) every billing period
   → contract checks: now >= last_charged + interval
   → transfers amount from user → merchant via transfer_from
   → updates last_charged

4. User calls cancel() at any time
   → subscription marked inactive, no further charges possible
```

> **Important:** Soroban has no native cron jobs. The `charge()` function must be triggered externally — by your backend, a keeper service, or a scheduled cloud function. See [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for keeper setup.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rust | 1.70+ | [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) |
| wasm32 target | — | `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown` |
| Soroban CLI | latest | `cargo install --locked soroban-cli` |
| Node.js | 18+ | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) |
| Freighter Wallet | latest | [freighter.app](https://www.freighter.app/) |

---

### 1 — Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SiLioLabs/PayFlow.git
cd flowpay
```

### 2 — Build & test the contract

```bash
cd contract
cargo test
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

All 3 tests should pass:
```
test test::test_cancel                  ... ok
test test::test_subscribe_and_charge    ... ok
test test::test_charge_too_early        ... ok
```

### 3 — Deploy to Testnet

```bash
# Generate and fund a testnet keypair
soroban keys generate --global deployer --network testnet

# Deploy the compiled WASM
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/flowpay.wasm \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet
# → prints your CONTRACT_ID

# Initialize with the native XLM token
soroban contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source deployer \
  --network testnet \
  -- initialize \
  --token CDLZFC3SYJYDZT7K67VZ75HPJVIEUVNIXF47ZG2FB2RMQQVU2HHGCYSC
```

For full deployment instructions including mainnet, see [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

### 4 — Run the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install

# Set your deployed contract ID
echo "VITE_CONTRACT_ID=<CONTRACT_ID>" > .env.local

npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`, connect Freighter (set to Testnet), and subscribe.

## Contract Reference

| Function | Auth Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `initialize(token)` | — | One-time setup. Sets the token contract address. |
| `subscribe(user, merchant, amount, interval)` | `user` | Creates or updates a subscription. |
| `charge(user)` | — | Triggers a charge if the interval has elapsed. |
| `pay_per_use(user, amount)` | `user` | Instant microtransaction against an active subscription. |
| `cancel(user)` | `user` | Deactivates a subscription. |
| `get_subscription(user)` | — | Read-only. Returns the subscription struct or `None`. |
